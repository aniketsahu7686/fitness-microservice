This is a microservices-based architecture designed to handle user authentication, activity tracking, and AI-powered processing. It uses multiple components that work together to provide scalability, security, and advanced features.

Step-by-Step Explanation
1. Clients and Entry Point

Users access the system through laptops or mobile devices.
All requests first go through an API Gateway.

Think of this as the “front door” that controls and routes traffic to the right services.




2. Authentication

Before accessing any service, users are authenticated by Keycloak (Auth Server).
This ensures secure login and token-based access control.


3. Core Application Components
Inside the main box, we have the core microservices:

USER Service

Stores user details in a MySQL database.


ACTIVITY Service

Tracks user activities and stores them in MongoDB.
Sends activity data to a Queue for asynchronous processing.


AI Service

Picks up data from the Queue.
Processes it using AI logic and stores results in another MongoDB.
Connects to Google’s Gemini Server for advanced AI capabilities.




4. Supporting Infrastructure

RabbitMQ: Handles message queues for reliable communication.
Config Server: Centralized configuration for all microservices.
Eureka Server: Service discovery so microservices can find each other dynamically.


How It Works Together

A user performs an action → API Gateway routes it → Auth Server validates → Activity is recorded → Sent to Queue → AI Service processes → Results stored and optionally enhanced by Google Gemini.


Why This Design?
Scalability: Each service can scale independently.
Security: Authentication and token validation via Keycloak.
Resilience: Queue ensures tasks are processed even if AI Service is busy.
Extensibility: Easy to add more services or integrate external AI.
